# pyCaster

Python port of [Code-It-Yourself! First Person Shooter by javid9x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8skO7MFYw). Only works on windows because i cant figure out how to do keyboard polling on a linux terminal (feel free to submit a PR if you know how)

requires [pywin32](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases) and python 3

run using

```
python main.py
```

runs like a hot mess, written in about 10h between a monday and a tuesday
